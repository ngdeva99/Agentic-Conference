**Agentic Conference**
The overall project is to scrape repositories like arXiv for 2024 papers and create a virtual conference per topic (Architecture, Programming, AI).
The evaluation will use only Agents, with no human in the loop. Create a "competition" in pairs, similar to a league structure.

**Clustering**
Objective: Create different clustering mechanisms using references from published papers so that papers can be grouped for competition or leagues (Architecture vs. Programming vs. AI vs. others)

**Evaluate Plots/Figures**
Objective: Use multimodal approaches to evaluate issues/problems with plots and point to potential issues or style problems

**Pair Compare Papers**
Objective: Create an agentic flow that reads PDF papers and compares papers using several categories
Team Size: 2
Description: The competition compares several contributions in the papers: impact, novelty, ease of understanding, etc.
Different LLM prompts and models compare the papers and assign points based on strong or small differences.

**Website**
Objective: Create a website with the league results and comparisons so that people can see the reasons for points and they can "thumbs up/down" or provide comments. The comments (like posts) will be visible.
